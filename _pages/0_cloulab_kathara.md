### Overview
You will do your assignments for CS 356 using  [CloudLab](http://cloudlab.us/) and [Kathara](https://www.kathara.org/). CloudLab is a research facility that provides bare-metal access and control over a substantial set of computing, storage, and networking resources. If you haven’t worked in CloudLab before, you need to register a CloudLab account. Kathara is a network emulation tool that enables you to test your network programs without multiple physical servers and network devices.
This small assignment walks you through the CloudLab registration process and shows you how to start an experiment in CloudLab. In addition, you will try out Kathara.
You should submit a per-group report that shows you have successfully followed the process.
Most importantly, it introduces our policies on using CloudLab that will be enforced throughout the semester.

**NOTE**: `$ [shell_command]` indicates to execute `[shell_command]` in your terminal.

### Register a CloudLab Account
* Visit [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us/signup.php) and create an account using your UT Austin email address as an email.

		1. Install OpenSSH \\
		macOS: `$ brew install openssh`\\
		Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server`  
		2. Generate a key pair with `ssh-keygen`\\
		You can use the below example as it is or try other cryptographic algorithms you prefer (see [man ssh-keygen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html))  
		Example: `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
		3. Type enter without typing any character when the prompt asks for the file path and passphrase. 
			* If you want to save your keys other than the default location, enter a file path (e.g., `~/foo/mykey`) to save your private key when the prompt asks for it. 
			* If you want additional security, type a passphrase when the prompt asks for it.
		4. The private key will be saved into the default location, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. `~/.ssh/id_rsa` is your private key and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is your public key (upload this during the account registration).
			* If you have entered a non-default file path,

* If you already have an account, click your username at the top right corner and then select `Start/Join Project` and type `utcs356` into the ProjectID field.

Once you complete the above steps, the instructor or TA will approve your request to join the project so that you can start an experiment.

### Start an Experiment
An experiment in CloudLab means the instantiation of a profile. You can think of a profile as a pre-configured VM image that includes OS and necessary setup. An experiment lasts only for the reserved hours, and all the changes you made on top of the profile will be discarded. Make sure that you use a private git repository to save your code.

1. To start a new experiment, go to your CloudLab dashboard and click the `Experiments` tab in the upper left corner. Then select `Start Experiment`, moving to the profile selection panel.
![start_exp_step1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step1.png)
2. Click `Change Profile`.
![start_exp_step2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step2.png)
3. Select a profile from the list. Choose the `cs356-base` profile in the `utcs356` project. With this profile, you can launch one machine with the Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS image with Docker and Kathara additionally installed.
![start_exp_step3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step3.png)
4. Click `Next` to move to the next panel (`Parameterize`).
![start_exp_step4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step4.png)
5. Click `Next` to move to the next panel (`Finalize`). You don't need to parameterize an experiment unless explicitly mentioned.
![start_exp_step5]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step5.png)
6. Here, you should name your experiment with `CSLogin1-CSLogin2` (`CSLogin1` is the cs username of Member 1), select `utcs356` as `Project`, and your assignment group as `Group` (You will be invited. If you're not yet invited, `Group` might not appear. You're ok to proceed without selecting `Group` for this assignment). You need to specify from which cluster you want to start your experiment. Please select the Wisconsin cluster. If it fails, then try another cluster. Click `Next` to move to the next panel (`Schedule`).
![start_exp_step6]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step6.png)
7. Enter the desired experiment duration and the time/date when you want to start the experiment. If you want to start your experiment as soon as possible, skip the `Start on date/time` field. Once your experiment is ready you will receive a notification email.
![start_exp_step7]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step7.png)
8. You can navigate to your CloudLab user dashboard to see your list of active experiments. You will move to a webpage describing project details by clicking on the experiment name. 
![start_exp_step8_1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step8_1.png)
Click the `List View` on that page, which opens a table where you can obtain the SSH login command (`ssh <cloudlab_id>@<cloudlab_host>`) to log in to your machine.
![start_exp_step8_2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment0/start_exp_step8_2.png)

9. Try to login to the machine by executing the provided SSH command in your terminal. This step will only work if you have uploaded your SSH public key to your CloudLab account. Add your public key if you did not add it during the registration ([here](https://www.cloudlab.us/ssh-keys.php)). 
	* `$ ssh <cloudlab_id>@<cloudlab_host>`
	* You may want to setup remote development on VSCode. Make sure the above ssh command works before VSCode setup.  
	<details>
	<summary markdown="span">VSCode setup</summary>
	1. Install the [Remote-SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
	2. In VS Code, select Remote-SSH: Connect to Host... from the Command Palette (F1) and use the same `<cloudlab_id>@<cloudlab_host>` as in the above ssh command.
	3. If VS Code cannot automatically detect the type of server you are connecting to, you will be asked to select the type manually. Select `Linux`.
	4. You can then open any folder or workspace on the remote machine using File > Open... or File > Open Workspace... just as you would locally!
	
	Refer to the [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host) for more detailed instructions.

### Tasks
#### Part 1: Check for the Available Resources
Check for the number of CPU physical cores and logical cores (threads) available (use `$ lshw -class cpu` or `$ lscpu`) and memory available (use `$ free -h`) on the node you reserved.  
**Report** the available resources in your report. 
#### Part 2: Create a virtual network with Kathará
Throughout the assignments, we will use [Kathará](https://www.kathara.org/), an open-source container-based network emulation system. With the network emulation tools like Kathará, we can test (network) applications without multiple servers and network devices. In Kathara, you can create a virtual network consisting of multiple virtual network devices by launching a Kathara lab. A Kathara lab directory in which you launch the lab defines a virtual network to be created. 

1. Setup  

After ssh to the reserved node, type the command below.  
```
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```  
Then **restart the SSH session** to make sure the changes are applied.    

{:start="2"}
2. Launch a Kathara lab to create a virtual network

Run the below commands. The below will launch a virtual network defined in the Kathara lab directory, `assignment1/labs/two_hosts_direct/`.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/utcs356/assignment1.git  
$ cd assignment1/labs/two_hosts_direct  
$ kathara lstart  
```

{:start="3"}
3. Connect to the virtual network devices generated by Kathara.

There are two virtual network devices in this Kathara lab, `h1` and `h2`. Create two separate terminals with `tmux`. `tmux` allows you to create multiple terminals without multiple SSH connections. Expand the below for its usage.

<details>

<summary markdown="span">tmux usage</summary>
* A brief introduction to `tmux`  
With `tmux`, you can create multiple windows (full-sized terminals) and divide them into panes (splitted terminals) on a single SSH connection. Start a new tmux session on a SSH terminal, by typing `$ tmux`. To execute the tmux command such as creating and splitting a window, you should first type the trigger key (`Ctrl+b` by default) to change the cursor from a terminal to the `tmux` command bar. You can split the window vertically with `Ctrl+b %` and horizontally with `Ctrl+b "`. You can move cursors from a pane to adjacent panes by using `Ctrl+b <arrow_key>`. You can create a window with `Ctrl+b c`, move to the next window with `Ctrl+b n`, and go back to the previous window with `Ctrl+b p`.
* Make as many panes/windows as you want, then connect to the Kathara node on each pane/window.
* Refer to [here](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) for more details on how to use `tmux`.  

</details>

<br>
In each terminal, connect to each device with `$ kathara connect <device_name>` (e.g., `$ kathara connect h1`). Make sure you launch the command in the lab directory. 

{:start="4"}
4. Check the virtual network devices

Run `$ ifconfig` ([man ifconfig](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ifconfig.8.html)) to identify the network interfaces and their IP addresses on each device (terminal). 
**Report** the IP address of the network interface attached to each device in your report. Please include a screenshot includes both devices' outputs of `ifconfig` on a `tmux` window. 

{:start="5"}
5. Clean up the Kathara lab

Don't forget to run `$ kathara lclean` in the lab directory when you're done with your lab.

**NOTE:** You should follow these steps to run a Kathará lab throughout the assignments.

#### Deliverable
Your report should be a pdf file named `assign0_groupX.pdf`, where `X` is your group number. Your report must include your group’s number, members, and their EIDs. Please submit one report per group.


### Policies on Using CloudLab Resources
* Please read and follow Cloudlab's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.cloudlab.us/aup.php).
* CloudLab gives users 16 hours to start with, and users can extend it longer. You can manage your time efficiently and only hold onto those nodes when working on the assignment. 
* You should use a private git repository to manage your code and terminate the nodes when you are not using them. If you do need to extend the nodes, do not extend them by more than one day. We will terminate any cluster running for more than 48 hours.
* As a member of the `utcs356` project, you have permission to create new experiments in the default group in addition to the group you are invited to. Stick to your own group and use naming formats as mentioned. For more information related to this, please refer to https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php
* Each cluster has different hardware. For more information on CloudLab's hardware, please refer to [this](http://docs.cloudlab.us/hardware.html).
