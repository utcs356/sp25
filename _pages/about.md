### Course Overview

This is a graduate-level course on computer networking. In this course
we will explore both classic and recent topics in computer networking. The
objectives of this course are:

* To understand the history of computer networking, state-of-the-art network protocols at various layers, network architectures, and networked systems. 
* To critically review research papers in computer networking and networked systems.
* To explore research problems and investigate new ideas through a semester-long research project.

The course is structured around lectures by the instructor and paper
readings/presentations by the students with open discussion. Students will form
a project group (two or three students) and conduct a research project on
computer networks or networked systems.
