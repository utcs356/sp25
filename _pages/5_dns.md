### Part 0: Setup and Overview
#### Setup
In this assignment, we recommend you use `cs356-base` or `cs356-p4` profile on CloudLab for implementing and testing your code.
To get the skeleton code, create a **private** repository by clicking `Use this template> Create a repository` on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/utcs356/assignment5.git).

#### Overview
In this assignment, you will implement DNS servers that enable a client to access nodes with domains instead of raw IP addresses. Your task is to complete the implementation of DNS nameservers for the `utexas.edu` zone and `cs.utexas.edu` zone (Part 1) and a local DNS server that can handle the query iteratively (Part 2). We provide you with a DNS library that does tedious jobs such as message parsing on behalf of you. Refer to the Appendix for more details on the library. For simplicity, you can assume there are no incoming queries other than `A, AAAA, NS` queries.

You will run this experiment on top of Kathara. The Kathara topology is depicted below. The Kathara lab is located in the `[a5_directory]/labs/dns`.

### Part 1: Writing DNS servers
Your task is to complete `ut-dns.c` and `cs-dns.c` in the `[a5_directory]/labs/dns/shared/src` directory. `ut-dns.c` and `cs-dns.c` are the nameservers for `utexas.edu` and `cs.utexas.edu`, respectively. The implementation of the two servers should be almost the same except for the DNS records they store. We recommend you implement `ut-dns.c` first, copy and paste it to `cs-dns.c`, and change it a bit. Note that they are **NOT** recursive nor iterative DNS servers, so their responses are only based on their own DNS records.

The overview for this part of the assignment is depicted below.    
![a5_p1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment5/A5_P1.png)   

#### Specification
You can find the step-by-step specifications in the starter codes as well.
* The servers should receive a message on top of UDP. Note that a UDP server doesn't have to `listen()` and `accept()` since it is connectionless, unlike TCP (what we did in A1). Also, the UDP server should use `sendto()`/`recvfrom()` to set/get a client's address along with sending/receiving a message.
* Initialize a server-wide context (e.g., DNS records) using TDNSInit(). The context will be used for future DNS-related operations such as searching for a DNS record.
* Create a zone using `TDNSCreateZone` and add records to the server `TDNSAddRecord`. You should be able to infer the contents of records from the comments in the source code and the topology figure.
* Receive a message continuously and parse it using `TDNSParseMsg()`.
* If the received message is a query for A, AAAA, or NS, find the corresponding record using `TDNSFind()` and return the response. Ignore all the other messages.

#### Test your implementation
1. Compile your code with `$ make` in the lab's shared directory (`[a5_directory]/labs/dns/shared`). The compiled binary would be in the `[a5_directory]/labs/dns/shared/bin` directory.
2. Run a server on the corresponding Kathara node. Make sure to start an experiment with `$ kathara lstart`.   
For testing `ut-dns.c`,     
`$ kathara connect ut_dns`      
`$ ./shared/bin/ut-dns`    
For testing `cs-dns.c`,    
`$ kathara connect cs_dns`   
`$ ./shared/bin/cs-dns`    
3. Send A queries and check the response with `$ dig`.    
`$ kathara connect h1`   
* For testing `ut-dns.c`, run below on `h1`.   
`$ dig @40.0.0.20 A www.utexas.edu`      
`$ dig @40.0.0.20 A thisshouldfail.utexas.edu`     
`$ dig @40.0.0.20 A cs.utexas.edu`     
`$ dig @40.0.0.20 A aquila.cs.utexas.edu`     
* For testing `cs-dns.c`, run below on `h1`.   
`$ dig @50.0.0.30 A cs.utexas.edu`     
`$ dig @50.0.0.30 A aquila.cs.utexas.edu`     
`$ dig @50.0.0.30 A thisshouldfail.cs.utexas.edu`     

### Part 2: An Iterative Local DNS Server
Your task is to complete `local-dns.c` in the `[a5_directory]/labs/dns/shared/src` directory. `local-dns.c` is a default nameserver for the on-campus network. Note that it is an iterative DNS server, so its response should be always an answer or error. If it receives a DNS record that indicates delegation (referral), it should resolve a query iteratively.
The below figure is an example of an iterative query resolution that is possible in our setup.     
![a5_p2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/assignment5/A5_P2.png)    

#### Specification
You can find the step-by-step specifications in the source code as well.
* The servers should receive a message on top of UDP.
* Initialize a server-wide context (e.g., DNS records) using TDNSInit(). The context will be used for future DNS-related operations such as searching for a DNS record.
* Create a zone using `TDNSCreateZone` and add records to the server `TDNSAddRecord`. You should be able to infer the contents of records from the comments in the source code and the topology figure.
* Receive a message continuously and parse it using `TDNSParseMsg()`.
* If the received message is a query for A, AAAA, or NS, find the corresponding record using `TDNSFind()`. Ignore all the other messages.
    1. If the record is found and the record indicates delegation, send an iterative query to the corresponding nameserver. Note that the server should store a per-query context using `putAddrQID()` and `putNSQID()` for future response handling.
    2. If the record is found and the record doesn't indicate delegation, send a response back to the client.
    3. If the record is not found, send a response back to the client. (The library would set the error flag.)
* If the received message is a response
    1. and it is an authoritative response (i.e., final response), add the NS information to the response and send it to the original client. Delete a per-query context using `delAddrQID()` and `delNSQID()`. You can retrieve the NS and client address information for the response using `getNSbyQID()` and `getAddrbyQID()`. You can add the NS information to the response using `TDNSPutNStoMessage()`.  
    2. and it is a non-authoritative response (i.e., it indicates delegation), send an iterative query to the corresponding nameserver. You can extract the query from the response using `TDNSGetIterQuery()`. The server should update a per-query context using `putNSQID()`.

### Test your implementation
1. Compile your code with `$ make` in the lab's shared directory (`[a5_directory]/labs/dns/shared`). The compiled binary would be in the `[a5_directory]/labs/dns/shared/bin` directory.
2. Run the DNS servers on the corresponding Kathara nodes. 
* Run a Kathara experiment.  
`$ kathara lstart`   
* Run the UT nameserver.  
`$ kathara connect ut_dns`   
`$ ./shared/bin/ut-dns`    
* Run the CS nameserver.  
`$ kathara connect cs_dns`   
`$ ./shared/bin/cs-dns`  
* Run the local DNS server.    
`$ kathara connect local_dns`    
`$ ./shared/bin/local-dns`    
3. Configure the local DNS server on `h1`.    
`$ kathara connect h1`         
`$ echo "nameserver 20.0.0.10" >> /etc/resolv.conf`   
4. Send A queries and check the response with `$ dig` on `h1`.       
`$ dig A ns.utexas.edu`       
`$ dig A www.utexas.edu`     
`$ dig A abc.utexas.edu`     
`$ dig A cs.utexas.edu`      
`$ dig A aquila.cs.utexas.edu`    
`$ dig A abc.utexas.edu`   
5. Try to use domain names with `$ ping`.    
The `-n` flag is necessary since the servers ignore a reverse query (PTR).   
`$ ping -n www.utexas.edu`    
`$ ping -n aquila.cs.utexas.edu`
