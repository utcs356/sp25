### Overview

The course project is an open-ended research project in networking done in groups of one or two. We will provide a list of project ideas. We also highly encourage you to bring your own ideas.

***

### Project ideas

We will post some ideas here on Aug 29 (Wed): Project ideas

***

### Proposal
Describe the project idea/application, how it relates to the course material, what work must be done (suggesting how it can be partitioned among you), and what resources you will need (including software systems you already have access to). Concentrate on convincing us that it will pertain to the course, that you will be able to complete it, and that we will be able to evaluate it. The third page should outline your intended final paper, identifying the specific experiments to run and the questions they will answer.

In your proposal, include three types of goals: 75% goals, 100% goals, and 125% goals. Think of these as the equivalent of a B, an A, and a "wow!" grade. The goals can be dependent or independent of the previous goals.

Consider also providing answers to the Heilmeier QuestionsLinks to an external site. in your proposal, as appropriate.

Please use the ACM HotNets Latex templateLinks to an external site. for the proposal and final report.
